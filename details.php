<h1 style="color:red;":>PRISM-ELITE (English Language Initiative for Training Experts)</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:blue; float:left; margin-left:150px;">The Vision</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="p">
    <p>Research is the key to development. This is an era of specialization. But even a well-trained researcher in every field – Pure Science, Life Science, Medicine, Pharmacy, Engineering and Technology or even disciplines like Economics, Commerce, Sociology, Arts is required to put his work on paper/print/electronic media. The only common thread uniting all the experts is English as a medium of communication. The rate of success increases with the improvement in communication skills.</p>        
    <br>
        <p>Currently, English has linguistic supremacy over other languages. The international academia is a blend of hard working nationalities particularly from Asian sub-continent for whom English is a second or third language for instance <span style="color:darkslateblue">Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Russian, Korean origin</span> researcher. Each subject expert may not be automatically equally skillful in the contemporary reigning medium of expression, English. <span style="color:darkred">A void was felt by researchers as there was no specialized help available. PRISM-ELITE was created with a vision to mentor the language aspect of the researcher.</span>
        
        <p>Moreover,interdisciplinary approach to research gives better results and globalization is the new code to excel. A life scientist requires as much help of a statistician to analyze data as a statistician needs various kinds of data to put his own formulae/methods to be tested.<span style="font-weight:900;"> How will the two communicate?</span> Similarly, a German Sociologist might require the help of a Korean nutrition expert. A Japanese physicist and a Sri Lankan mathematician help each other, a Pakistani chemist might seek help from a Nigerian pharmacist and vice versa. An Indian Psychologist and an Iranian Neuroscientist along with a Chinese Statistician might work wonders for the humanity. A French artist might need some help in Russian history, to prepare digital designs using Indian graphics expert. Each expert has a diverse ethnic Non-English speaking background for, instance Chinese start learning English in college.  But, today they need to converse and put their work in English. As a result non –native speakers of language don’t understand fine nuances and grammar. <span style="color:blue;">PRISM-ELITE</span> is an English Language Initiative catering to the needs of research community.</p>  
        
        <p>The current generation of professionals is breaking cultural and lingual boundaries to excel using English as a common medium of communication.</p>
        
        <p> <span style="color:darkred">PRISM-ELITE</span> is an effort to re-acquaint busy professionals who have mediocre English language expertise and limited time with an up-to-date knowledge of English Grammar. <span style="color:darkred;">PRISM-ELITE is a free community service to hone the English Skills of an expert so as to improve his/her chances of glory.

        <br>
        <br>
        <p><span style="font-weight:900">PRISM EDITING SERVICES</span> is an editing service by a group of researchers. Researchers for whom English is a second language face it challenging to publish a paper in a journal of repute. Professional editing is required to display the meticulously performed study on a visible reputed platform in order to harness success.In an era of extensive cuts on budgeting of education and research,expensive editing makes it difficult for an average investigator with modest grant to get the painstakingly written manuscript undergo expert checking. The founders of Prism Editing Services, themselves being researchers, felt an insiders’ need for a professional editing service by people who understand the subject as well as the language aspect of the manuscript so that the central idea of the paper is not lost or subdued while improving it.</p>

        <h1 style="color:darkblue; float:left;">The Problem</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>In order to create a positive effect, one aspires to have an error-free communication. The aspirant who wantsto make his/her work visible at the international level, necessarily need to be proficient in the current linguistic format.Effective use of language is necessary to express/persuade/convince the listener or reader.Your valuable theory/idea, whatever it may be important, if it is full of mistakes or repeated words make an undesirable effect.</p>
        
        <h1 style="color:darkblue; float:left;">The Goal</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Every professional/academician/researcherseeks to make an impact. Developing competence after due recognition of one’s own area of weakness is a symbol of wisdom. <span style="color:green;"> If aptitude in English is hampering ones rate of success, it’s better to improve the coveted skill.</span> Better communication techniques are instrumental for the success of a dedicated individual. Improved expertise in language leads to enhanced exchange of ideas at verbal or scriptedformats, leading to<span style="color:darkred;"> a successful career.</span>
        </p>
        
         
        <h1 style="color:darkblue; float:left;">The Target audience</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>A number of researchers learnt English as a second or third language; therefore, they fall out while interacting with native speakers.It has been observed that they are uncomfortable while giving presentations or feel awkward answering queries or during interviews. <span style="color:green;"> The highly intelligent,talented and hard-working professionals sometimes trail behind those with better expressions or command of the English language.</span>  A demanding career leaves little time to take out grammar books or take classes to acquire much required language skills.
